// cannot be read. Each call is written to the FunctAI call log, so the calls
// show in the Programs pages with their inputs and outputs, can be judged,
// and a change of instruction is a new version that can be compared.
//
// The instructions are the prompts Chattering used before, nearly word for
// word; only "reply with strict JSON in this shape" went, because the shape is
// now the program's outputs and FunctAI writes and reads the reply form.
// Output names inside records keep the keys the rest of the server reads.
//
// Not programs here, on purpose:
// - deriving a notebook from an answer (the reply rides on the conversation's
//   own Pi session and cached context);
// - the simpler rewrite of a reply (inside the Pi session that answered);
// - the TypeSafe voice commands (their choices are what is on the screen at
//   that moment, a different question every time).
